Project Name: TodoApp – React/Next.js To-Do List Application
Tested By: Andreja Mihajlovski
Date: 04-Aug-2025
Version Tested: v1.0.0
Test Type: Manual Functional Testing

1. Purpose
The purpose of this report is to formally close the testing phase for the TodoApp project, summarizing the completed testing activities, documenting unresolved issues 
and confirming the readiness for releaseor further development.

2. Summary of Activities
• Designed and executed 10 test cases (5 positive, 5 negative).
• Performed functional testing on CRUD operations, filtering, persistence, and UI behavior.
• Documented 10 bug reports with severity classifications.
• Verified application behavior under normal, edge, and invalid input conditions.
• Conducted UI responsiveness and basic accessibility checks.

3. Test Results Overview
• Total Test Cases Executed: 10
• Passed: 8
• Failed: 2 (due to open critical/high-severity bugs)
• Bugs Found: 10
o Critical: 1
o High: 1
o Medium: 4
o Low: 4

4. Outstanding Issues
Unresolved issues impacting release readiness:
1. BR001: Adding empty task allowed (Medium).
2. BR002: Edit task accepts empty text (High).
3. BR004: UI breaks on corrupted localStorage (Critical).
Recommendation: These must be resolved before production deployment.

5. Exit Criteria Evaluation
• All planned test cases executed: 
• All critical and high-severity bugs resolved:(pending)
• Functional coverage: 
• Non-functional/accessibility testing: (basic checks)

6. Lessons Learned
• Validation needs to be prioritized early in the development cycle to prevent high-impact functional bugs.
• Error handling for persistence mechanisms like localStorage should be part of the initial design to avoid critical runtime failures.
• UI responsiveness and accessibility should be integrated into ongoing QA, not deferred to later stages.

7. Conclusion
Testing for the TodoApp v1.0.0 has been completed with 80% pass rate. The application is not yet ready for production release due to unresolved high-impact bugs.
Once these issues are addressed, a short regression cycle is recommended before deployment.
